# anki-reset-card-scheduling

*Ever imported someone else's deck that contained scheduling information associated with cards?* It's really annoying. Until now, the only way to fix the problem was to re-export the deck and un-check the "Include Scheduling Information" checkbox.

Well, no more! Install this add-on, go into the *card browser* (click the "Browse" option from the main deck browser). *Select* some cards (maybe with Control-A?), and choose the Edit menu option: *"Reset scheduling and learning on selected cards."* If you don't like the changes, you can always Edit -> Undo (Control-Z) afterward.

This add-on also *allows you delete your own scheduling information*. I acknowledge that this usage case breaks the spatial repetition concept and goes against the spirit of Anki. If you do this, you risk having uncomfortable dreams, and all flowers within a ten-meter radius of your position might suddenly and spontaneously wilt.
